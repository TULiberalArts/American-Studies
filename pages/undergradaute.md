## Courses

- AMST 0801. Philadelphia Arts & Culture. 4 Credit Hours.

What and where is the real Philadelphia? How can we get past the clichés to better understand and experience the city's historic and legendary sense of itself? For more than three centuries, Philadelphia's unique identity has been defined and redefined by a prodigious and prolific creative community: painters, sculptors, writers, performers, architects, planners, thinkers, and more. We'll explore Philadelphia's evolving sense of itself through a broad range of examples of creative works from the 17th through the 20th centuries. And through this prism of expression, and the institutions that present and protect it, we'll develop a deep understanding of Philadelphia as one of the nation's most creative cities. NOTE: This course fulfills the Arts (GA) requirement for students under GenEd and Arts (AR) for students under Core. Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have successfully completed American Studies 0901.

- AMST 0847. American Military Culture. 3 Credit Hours.

You live in a country that possesses the world's strongest military forces. Up through the Vietnam War, Americans viewed military service in wartime as a basic obligation for all adult male citizens - the ultimate test of their patriotism and manhood - but a temporary sacrifice that ceased for most on the return of peace. Today, the American people have outsourced their awesome war-making power to a restricted number of men and women - many of whom consider military service their career. We will explore the distinctive culture that shapes the composition and behavior of America's armed forces and probe how it reflects the strengths and weaknesses of American society. NOTE: This course fulfills the U.S. Society (GU) requirement for students under GenEd and American Culture (AC) for students under Core.

- AMST 0848. American Revolutions. 3 Credit Hours.

From the first encounters with Native Americans to the present, a series of pivotal moments have had an enduring influence on American society, culture, and politics. In each class, three modules will focus on three pivotal moments, such as King Philip's War, Nat Turner's Rebellion, the Scopes trial, the Civil Rights movement, the women's movement, the emergence of Elvis Presley, the sexual revolution, the rise of environmentalism, the Reagan Revolution, and 9-11. In each module, students will first place the main subject of the module in context, and then seek to understand how it changed American society. The last week of each module will be devoted to a consideration of how the subject of that module has become part of American collective memory. NOTE: This course fulfills the U.S. Society (GU) requirement for students under GenEd and American Culture (AC) for students under Core.

- AMST 0855. Higher Education and American Life: Mirror to a Nation. 3 Credit Hours.

You have decided to go to college. But why? What role will college and in particular Temple University play in your life? Reflect on this important question by looking at the relationship between higher education and American society. What do colleges and universities contribute to our lives? They are, of course, places for teaching and learning. They are also research centers, sports and entertainment venues, sources of community pride and profit, major employers, settings for coming-of-age rituals (parties, wild times, courtship, etc.), and institutions that create lifetime identities and loyalties. Learn how higher education is shaped by the larger society and how, in turn, it has shaped that society. Become better prepared for the world in which you have chosen to live for the next few years. NOTE: This course fulfills the U.S. Society (GU) requirement for students under GenEd and American Culture (AC) for students under Core.

Terrorism, illegal immigration, gay marriage, religious conflict, political in-fighting, corporate corruption, racial animosities, civil liberties assaults, media conglomeration, Wal-Mart goes to China and the rich get richer. America in the 21st Century is a contentious society. How did we get to this place in time? Examine what makes American society distinctive from other advanced industrial democracies as we study the philosophical origins of America, the development of social and economic relationships over time, and the political disputes dominating contemporary American life. The course relies heavily on perspectives from History, Sociology and Political Science to explain the challenges facing contemporary American society.

- AMST 0862. First Person America. 3 Credit Hours.

Examine the private and public lives of a diverse cast of Americans over a long sweep of the nation's history. Along the way, look at how fundamental conflicts - between the local and the national, freedom and equality, inclusion and exclusion, community and the individual - have driven U.S. history from its very beginnings, how they have shaped these individual lives and how these individuals have molded the debates. Learn to use a range of sources - including autobiographies, biographies, memoirs, personal narratives, profiles, bio-pics, self-portraits, visual and performance pieces - as you investigate these American stories and American tensions. NOTE: This course fulfills the U.S. Society (GU) requirement for students under GenEd and American Culture (AC) for students under Core.

- AMST 0864. Sounds of a Revolution. 3 Credit Hours.

This course will explore the history of the Uptown Theater and the North Philadelphia neighborhood just north of Temple University that surrounded the music hall. It will dig deep into the history of the Uptown Theater to help students better understand the complex processes and interactions of urban change and the shifting geographies and meanings of race and popular culture in postwar America. Students will learn about the close connections between music and society, art and commerce, and race and urban change. At the same time, they will explore the processes and politics of recovering the past and reconstructing living histories out of the rubble and silences of yesterday. That is because, in addition to being an interdisciplinary study of the city and popular culture, this course will serve as an introduction to public history-the ideas and issues of preserving the past to use and understand the present.

- AMST 2001. Tourism in America. 3 Credit Hours.

A booming multinational industry, tourism is a powerful medium of transnational encounter. There is hardly a place on earth not part of the recreational geography of tourism. In practical terms, tourism is seen as an engine of economic growth both in the cities and in the countryside. While it moves people from one place to another, tourism produces itself with ever-greater complexity. This course will undertake an analysis of tourist productions, including tourist discourse, settings, events, experiences, and artifacts. An exemplary case of cultural invention and commodification, tourism is implicated in the histories of pilgrimage, travel, colonialism, and ethnography, retracing their trips and replicating their discourse, As a result, tourism offers some of the richest material for exploring the semiosis of cultural production on a global scale. In this course, therefore, we will pay special attention to the political economy of tourism as seen through a close analysis of actual sites.
Repeatability: This course may not be repeated for additional credits.

- AMST 2003. The American Sexual Past. 3 Credit Hours.

This course will explore the history of sexuality in America.

- AMST 2052. The Class Experience in America. 3 Credit Hours.

This course surveys the enduring importance of class in the United States as well as the enduring myth of American classlessness. We will start with the myths themselves, where they came from and how they were constructed. From there, we will examine theories of social class (in some ways attempts to explain why the myths weren't true) and efforts to objectively measure poverty, inequality, and the distribution of wealth. At the outset, we will also examine social mobility patterns and how these objective categories of class are related to race, region, sex, and gender. We will then spend time looking at how class is lived and how it is represented in the larger culture. We will explore how social class shapes the daily lives of ordinary Americans in cities, suburbs, small towns, and rural hinterlands through such things as housing, community, work, leisure activities, shopping tastes, dress, diet, language, education, and family. We will examine how class has been represented, reproduced, and contested, in literature, art, music, film, television, and the broader popular culture.

We have seen a tremendous curiosity for "things American" in Japanese daily life - but how is American culture in Japan? What kinds of transformations, reformulations and re-inventions have taken place? We will review Japanese adoptions and adaptations of language, "American" settings, architecture and design, foods and restaurants, clothing and fashions, popular films, television and advertising, and even holidays.

- AMST 2064. America in the 1950's. 3 Credit Hours.

This course will provide a survey of the 1950s, a time of deep, widespread, and lasting social change in the United States. Every aspect of the life of the country - government foreign and domestic policy, the workplace, entertainment, sports, the arts, and so forth - underwent some degree of significant alteration in the fifties. Some of this change resulted from the release of energy held in check by the Great Depression and World War II; some resulted from new technologies such as television and new spatial arrangements such as suburbanization; and some resulted from the emergence of new voices and styles (e.g., Abstract Expressionism, Rock and Roll, the Beats, bebop and other jazz forms) and more strenuous demands for freedom and equality by long-oppressed groups. While the course will survey the decade and the postwar era in general, it will also go into some depth by focusing on particular expressions of the major issues of the period.
Repeatability: This course may not be repeated for additional credits.

- AMST 2065. Global America. 3 Credit Hours.

This distance-learning course is designed to help students examine the United States' role in the modern, industrial, and then, post-industrial world. At the same time, we will look at how the larger world shaped the United States and individual citizens. We will do this through a topics based approach. Each week, moving in roughly chronological order, we will explore a discreet and revealing interaction between the United States - whether this side of the equation is represented by the government, corporate leaders, or culture brokers - and another part of the world - and this side might be other nations, groups of people, or intellectual concepts. Not only will students encounter a broad range of contacts on a wide front, but they will also be asked to write and think about each of these topics and moments from a broad and wide range of different vantage points.

- AMST 2098. Reading Culture. 3 Credit Hours.

As an introduction to the methods and scope of American Studies, Reading Culture will present an in-depth, interdisciplinary look at a discreet period in the American past, for example, the Civil War era or the Great Depression. While delving deeply in this time period, the class will explore how culture in its many forms and manifestations shaped how people lived their daily lives and created meaning. Particular emphasis will be placed on looking at the relationship, and even the disconnect, between different kinds of culture - knowledge production and education, visual culture, including art, photography, and film, music, landscapes, and built environments. In order to do that, we will learn how to read, broadly construe, and understand how different cultural forms convey messages and how distinct ways of seeing and hearing relate to other cultural forms. Through discussion, research, and writing, class members will investigate these varied dimensions of culture. They will learn to understand them in their broader social, aesthetic, ethical, and political contexts. In addition, this class, as an introduction, will prepare students to take more advanced courses in American Studies. This is also a writing-intensive class, so students will be engaged in extensive and varied writing (and rewriting) assignments and projects that will help them to hone these crucial skills.
