feature-title: Who We Are and What Our Students Do
feature-body: American Studies explores patterns and connections in US life. We look at the big themes, such as labor, mobility, migration, art, place, race, gender, and play. In the courses on social change, art, and work, for instance, we look at how Americans think, talk and express ideas in song, stories, and photographs. American Studies considers how these and other themes contribute to individual, family and community life.  American Studies offers a lively way of understanding ever-changing and always contested values,
looking at the politics of American culture through a variety of lenses.

American Studies stresses the development of advanced-level reading, writing, and analytical skills that are necessary for successful careers in various fields. Over our forty-year history, people who have majored or minored in American Studies have gone on to business, medical, law, journalism, museum, civic, teaching, and publishing careers. Our alumni tell us how valuable their American Studies educations have proven to be, testifying about how the knowledge and skills they learned with our faculty readily transferred into their careers.
