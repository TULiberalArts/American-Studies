American Studies stresses the development of advanced-level reading, writing, and analytical skills that are necessary for successful careers in various fields. Over our forty-year history, people who have majored or minored in American Studies have gone on to business, medical, law, journalism, museum, civic, teaching, and publishing careers. Our alumni tell us how valuable their American Studies educations have proven to be, testifying about how the knowledge and skills they learned with our faculty readily transferred into their careers.
